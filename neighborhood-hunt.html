		<h1>Neighborhood Hunt</h1>
		<p>Bringing Regent Square together through a year-long "treasure hunt"-type service in which newer residents can discover the neighborhood and the accompanying stories of older residents.</p>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>Our team (Course: Designing for Service; Carnegie Mellon University) was tasked to design a city-scale service for Regent Square in Pennsylvania - a neighborhood made up of four separate municipalities - Pittsburgh, Edgewood, Swissvale, and Wilkinsburg.</p>
		<h3>Timeline: 4/15/19 - 5/1/19 (2 weeks)</h3>

		<h3>My Role</h3>
		<p>I worked with my team on all parts of the service design process. Specifically, I shared responsibility for observation, interviews, brainstorming and ideation, development of our service concept, prototyping, service blueprinting and value exchange, and presentation.</p>

		<h2>Research</h2>
		<h3>Field Observations</h3>
		<p>We began by setting out and exploring Regent Square as a team. We sought out to better understand the people, businesses, events, and space of the city in order to get a glance at any potential for improvement through service design.</p>

		<p>Through our observational excursion, we found a neighborhood with a quaint atmosphere - full of history, nature, and eclectic houses and businesses.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Lots of mom-and-pop businesses: culturally diverse restaurants, variety of stores, dentists, salons, etc.</li>
			<li>Historical buildings and sites</li>
			<li>Mix of young and old people</li>
			<li>Lots of people walking dogs</li>
			<li>Lots of cars - crossing the road was difficult</li>
			<li>Found Frick Park - large historical park in Pittsburgh - as part of the neighborhood</li>
			<li>Drainage problems in some streets</li>
		</ul>

		<p>In order to get more insight into life in Regent Square, we interviewed three long term residents who discussed their experiences in the neighborhood through phone call.</p>

		<h3>Insights and Potential Directions</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Bureaucratic/ money issues due to different municipalities: Regent Square is a neighborhood made up of parts of the municipalities of Pittsburgh, Edgewood, Swissvale, and Wilkinsburg.</li>
			<li>Drainage Problems: Regent square has started experiencing a lot of drainage problems, and these have not been addressed.</li>
			<li>Common usage of Frick Park: The park, playground, Wilkins School, and Edgewood Town Center are shared with the rest of Swissvale and Wilkinsburg.</li>
			<li>Run Around The Square: Annual 5K event that residents value; runs through neighborhood streets and ends in Frick Park</li>
			<li>Yearly yard sale: Large, publicized springtime community-wide yearly garage sale hosted by the RSCA.</li>
			<li>Influx of new residents now residing with older residents: Regent Square is made up of many new residents, as well as those that have been there for decades</li>
			<li>Block parties: Occuring often amongst the neighborhood; an excuse for residents to hang out and have fun</li>
			<li>Lots of dog owners</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Brainstorming/ Ideation</h2>
		<p>While we were limited in tackling drainage or bureaucratic problems, we saw possibility in better connecting residents to their city and to each other. We aimed to conceptualize a service that would bring together old and new residents - possibly by supporting and intersecting with their highly cherished annual events (i.e., yard sale, 5k, block parties), the history throughout the neighborhood, or its businesses.</p>
