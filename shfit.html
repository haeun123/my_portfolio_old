    	<h1>SHFIT App</h1>
        <p>While flexibility in scheduling and work hours is growing more popular in the workspace, swapping shifts amongst employees can be a disorganized process. Shfit addresses the issues of matching skill level, communication, and confusion in scheduling and exchanging shifts amongst gym employees in one virtual space.</p>

    	<h2>Introduction</h2>
    	<p>Our team (Course: Interaction Design Overview, HCII CMU) was tasked to design a native mobile app in a funnel design process to allow for better shift swapping amongst employees. </p>

        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>I worked with a team on all parts of the design process. Specifically, I worked on the competitive analysis, interview with a business owner, helped with the customer journey map and created a manager persona, translated manager-side issues into UX solutions, created wireframes for messaging/notifying and the flowchart, refined the final stylized screens for messaging and chatting (and helped refine others), worked on inVision to prototype, helped with user testing, worked with my team to address and resolve conceptual issues in our iterations, and with delivery of the final pitch.</p>

    	<h2>Research and Competitive Analysis</h2>

    	<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
        <p>We looked at several top competitors for existing shift swapping applications, as well as the discussion and research insights surrounding their effectiveness and how well these app's features fit into the business context. We aimed to understand the existing issues around shift swapping and schedule instability, and how the features of these competititor applications have aimed to address these issues.</p>

        <h4>Shyft</h4>
        <p>Shyft is used in retail, restaurant, and service environments. It is used by 12,000 Starbucks employees, over 7,500 McDonalds employees, and over 3,500 Old Navy employees.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Allows workers to get rid of shifts, pick up extra ones</li>
            <li>can connect workers who live in the same general area but in different stores</li>
            <li>allows managers to approve or deny a shift swap</li>
            <li>some managers utilized Shyft by posting entire schedules on the app, allowing employees to choose their schedules.</li>

        </ul>

        <h4>Shift Messenger</h4>
        <p>Shift messenger was used by The Gap company in an experiment, which led to useful insights on shift swapping apps in the business context.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Saved 10/hours a week by removing the need for employees to make individual phone calls to each other when swapping shifts</li>
            <li>Led to a decrease in no-shows</li>
            <li>Feature: No manager approval required for swapping shifts with the app</li>
            <li><b>Issue: Some managers disliked the app due to the variable quality in their teams; shift swapping with employees with insufficient training for the role is a problem</b></li>

        </ul>

        <h4>Crew Messaging and Scheduling</h4>
        <p>Crew has been used by RPM Pizza, which operates 190 Domino's Pizzas in various states.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Improved accountability: shows managers which employees saw which messages</li>
            <li>Experiment saw higher engagement with millenials due to social space-like features - dashboard, individual and group messaging</li>
            <li>Double-digit sales growth with RPM</li>
            <li>23% increase in on-time store deliveries with RPM</li>
            <li>Coverage for vacant shifts increased from 15-20% to 75-80%</li>

        </ul>

        <h4>Sling</h4>
        <p>Sling is another app that allows for various work-related features in a single platform.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Newsfeed: "social space" quality</li>
            <li>Shift scheduling</li>
            <li>Messaging: direct and group</li>
            <li>Tasks feature</li>
            <li><a href="https://getsling.com/features/"><em>Click here for Sling Features</em></a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Increasing communication around scheduling was important, as well as accountability. Some of these apps have implemented a "social media" aspect into their applications successfully. It is important that managers have the option to approve shifts, after employees have been able to easily navigate shift swapping amongst themselves on a single platform. However, within shift swapping it seemed critical to address the issue of variable training/skill level amongst employees - a key issue that further affects customers and business needs.</p>

    	<h3>Interviews</h3>
        <p>My teammates conducted interviews with former and current gym workers (of other gyms and at Carnegie Mellon University), and I interviewed an owner of a franchise. Our purpose was to better understand the experiences of employees and managers around exchanging shifts in the workplace</p>

        <h4>Justin: 24, former trainer at a gym</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Goes to manager to ask to swap shifts, or...</li>
            <li>Contacts coworker to see which swaps are possible, then proposes to manager (in order to reduce work for the manager</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Jeff: 53, owner of a cleaning and restoration franchise</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Usually swap shifts by checking the schedule and approaching the employee in person at work</li>
            <li>Difficult to swap shifts when unable to find the right caliber of employee to take over the role</li>
            <li>Employees do not use any technologies to swap shifts</li>
            <li>Employees swap shifts for on-call times, such as Friday nights when they have an event to go to</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>At CMU Gym:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>There is no app that schedules shifts for different jobs</li>
            <li>There is an internal website for CMU students to schedule their shifts on - DoSportsEasy</li>
            <li>Lifeguards at the pool use SubItUp to schedule and substitute shifts.</li>
        </ul>

    	<h3>Additional Research</h3>
        <p>We conducted further secondary research to discover common employee scheduling problems and potential solutions.
